          <h3>3D SURVIVAL GAME</h3>
          <p>In this collaborative project, my primary focus was on procedural generation and optimization to enhance both gameplay and performance. I developed the system responsible for procedurally generating the terrain and desert buildings, creating a dynamic and immersive environment. Additionally, I implemented procedural generation for the interior layouts of buildings, ensuring varied and engaging exploration experiences for players. To support smooth gameplay, I worked on optimizing the terrain rendering, significantly reducing performance bottlenecks and delivering a seamless and visually appealing experience.</p>
